## 📂 Choose Your Studio

### 🌟 [Version 1: Emotional Identity Lock (Root)](https://github.com/ahmedahmed20008669/Qwen3-TTS-Studio-Fine-Tunned)
The core studio engine focused on **Voice Character Consistency**.
*   **Best for**: Podcasts, single-character narrations, and vocal stability.
*   **Workflow**: Define one voice identity and shift emotions mid-script without the character "drifting."
*   **Run**: `python app.py`

### 🎬 [Version 2: Cinematic Pro-Studio (Sub-Project)](https://github.com/ahmedahmed20008669/Qwen3-TTS-Studio-Fine-Tunned/tree/main/Cinematic-Studio)
A high-end **Multi-Character Casting Engine** with dramatic timing controls.
*   **Best for**: Audio Dramas, NPC Conversations, and Screenplays.
*   **Workflow**: Multi-character casting, em-dash (`—`) interruption handling, and `(Solo)` internal monologues.
*   **Run**: `cd Cinematic-Studio && python app.py`
